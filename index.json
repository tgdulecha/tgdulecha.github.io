December 2014, he won a 1-year research fellow to work on a project entitled \"Augmented reality framework for museums\" at IUAV University of Venice, Department of culture. In March 2015 he joined Hawassa University, Institute of Technology, School of informatics, and served as a lecturer. October 2016, he won a 1-year research fellow to work on a project entitled \"Automated inventory of a cooler\" at Ca'Foscari University, European Center for Living Technology(ECLT). In October 2017, he joined the University of Verona to pursue his Ph.D. and received Ph.D. in Computer Science on June 16, 2021. During his Ph.D. study, he had used different deep learning and machine learning techniques to solve different material appearance analysis problems. His research interests are in the areas of Measurement, analysis, and modeling of material appearance, Machine learning, and computer vision. \r  Download my resum√©.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Tinsae G.
